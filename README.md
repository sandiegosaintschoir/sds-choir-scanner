# San Diego Saints Choir Music Library System Scanner

A SvelteKit application for checking items in and out of the San Diego Saints Choir Music Library using barcode scanning.

**Live URL:** https://parkernilson.github.io/sds-choir-scanner/

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** SvelteKit
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (automatic deployment via GitHub Actions on push to `main` branch)

## Development Setup

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### HTTPS Configuration

This project uses HTTPS in development mode to enable secure features like camera access for barcode scanning.

#### Prerequisites

Install mkcert (if not already installed):

```bash
# macOS
brew install mkcert

# Install the local certificate authority
mkcert -install
```

#### Generate Certificates

1. Create the certs directory and generate certificates:

```bash
cd /path/to/multi-scanner
mkdir certs
cd certs
mkcert parkernilson-macbook.local localhost
```

This will create:

- `parkernilson-macbook.local+1-key.pem` (private key)
- `parkernilson-macbook.local+1.pem` (certificate)

NOTE: This should match your computer's mDNS name. (see: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-computers-local-hostname-mac-mchlp2322/mac)

#### Running the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start with HTTPS enabled:

- **Local access:** `https://localhost:5173`
- **Network access:** `https://parkernilson-macbook.local:5173`

#### Testing on Mobile Devices

To test on a mobile device connected to the same network:

1. Access the app at: `https://parkernilson-macbook.local:5173`

2. **(Optional)** To avoid certificate warnings on mobile devices, install the mkcert CA:
   - Find the CA location: `mkcert -CAROOT`
   - Share `rootCA.pem` to your mobile device (via AirDrop or email)
   - **iOS:** Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Install Profile, then Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → Enable full trust
   - **Android:** Settings → Security → Install from storage

#### Notes

- Certificates are gitignored and must be generated locally
- HTTPS is only enabled in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`)

## Production Deployment

This project is configured for static hosting on GitHub Pages at: `https://parkernilson.github.io/sds-choir-scanner/`

### Automatic Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch via GitHub Actions.

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger a deployment manually:

1. Go to the repository's Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Local Production Preview

To test the production build locally with the correct base path:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:4173/sds-choir-scanner/`

This previews the exact site that will be deployed to GitHub Pages, including the `/sds-choir-scanner/` base path.
